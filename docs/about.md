The Visualization Extension ***sense-navigation*** for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to navigate in your app:

* Go to the next sheet
* Go to the previous sheet
* Go to a specific sheet
* Go to a sheet (defined by the sheet Id)
* Go to a story
* Open a website
* Switch to the edit mode

The button can be easily styled nicely by selecting some of the predefined designs.

Furthermore ***sense-navigation*** offers the option to define **actions**~ which will be executed **before** the navigation happens.
This could for example be:

* Apply a bookmark
* Clear selections
* Lock selections
* Unlock selections
* Select value(s) in a field
* Select alternatives
* Select possible values in a field
* Set a variable value

See [here](./docs/actions.md) for a complete list of all available 20 actions.

Note: The main difference between version 0.x and 1.x of sense-navigation is that with v1.x you can define more than two actions.
